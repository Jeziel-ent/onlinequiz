The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based platform that enables multiple users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents simultaneously with instant synchronization. It eliminates the delays and confusion caused by sharing multiple file versions by allowing all participants to work together in real time within a single, unified document. The system is developed using modern web technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MongoDB, and Socket.io, providing both scalability and efficiency. Through JWT-based authentication, it ensures secure access, while role-based permissions define different levels of user control such as editors, viewers, and administrators. The platform also features version control, enabling users to view and restore previous document states, and an auto-save mechanism to prevent data loss. Real-time presence indicators show which collaborators are online and actively editing, enhancing communication and awareness among users. The editor is fully responsive, offering a smooth experience on desktops and mobile devices alike. Overall, the project aims to enhance productivity, promote teamwork, and deliver a secure, scalable, and user-friendly collaborative environment suitable for remote work, education, and enterprise-level document management.
